      <h1 class="textContent">What is this website?</h1>
      <p class="textContent">
        Well, this website is about finding texts online without the need of
        searching, while also being able to modify the text content without
        losing it's meaning.
      </p>
      <p class="textContent">
        Although my website is at initial states, I do pretend to upgrade it
        along the flow of time, but there shall be notes regarding the texts
        modifications:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul class="textContent">
        <li>
          <strong>The modifications are not made by AI</strong>, but by an
          <strong>regular script</strong>;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Since it is run by a script,
          <strong>do not expect the modifications to be flawless</strong>,
          take some time to read the text and
          <strong>change anything that does not enter in your preferences</strong>.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You can modify the texts at the
          <strong class="strongBinded">Text Modification Page</strong>, that
          can be reached by clicking at the <strong>Scroll Icon</strong> at
          the menu, and collect/find texts at the
          <strong class="strongBinded">Text Collection Page</strong>, which
          can be accessed by clicking the
          <strong>Magnifying Glass Icon</strong> at the menu. To return to
          the <strong class="strongBinded">Home Page</strong>, click at the
          <strong>House Icon</strong>.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          There will be options at the
          <strong class="strongBinded">Text Modification Page</strong>
          which will help you at modifying the text.
